		<h2> Early life </h2>
		<p> William George Morgan was born on January 23, 1870 in Lockport New York. He spent his childhood attending school and working at his father&rsquo;s boat yard on the banks of Old Erie Canal. William Morgan attended Northfield Mount Hermon School in 1891; there, he met the creator of basketball - James Naismith. William discovered his strong athletic skills and passion for sports in high school. 
		He decided to move on to attend the Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association (YMCA) Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. During his years at the YMCA, he played various sport teams and was very successful on his college football team. After William graduated in 1894, he pursued his career in physical education at the YMCA in Auburn, Maine. After a year, he moved to Holyoke, Massachusetts as he became the physical education director at the Holyoke YMCA. </p>
		<h2> Creating the Sport </h2>
		<p>While William Morgan worked as the Director of Physical Education at the YMCA in Holyoke, he started to notice that his class of weaker, non athletic young men and elders were not successful at playing the popular sport of basketball. They quickly got tired and were not able to keep up with running up and down the court. William G Morgan then had the idea of creating a game which combines techniques from many other sports that everyone could actively participate in. With the idea in mind, the first 	&ldquo;Mintonette&rdquo; game, now known as volley ball was played in December of 1895. The game quickly grew very successful. Today, volleyball is estimated by the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) as the most popular team sport in the world.</P>
