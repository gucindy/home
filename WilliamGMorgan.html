		<h2> Creating The Sport </h2>
		<p>While William Morgan worked as the Director of Physical Education at the YMCA in Holyoke, he started to notice that his class of weaker, non athletic young men and elders were not successful at playing the popular sport of basketball. They quickly got tired and were not able to keep up with running up and down the court. William G Morgan then had the idea of creating a game which combines techniques from many other sports that everyone could actively participate in. With the idea in mind, the first "Mintonette" game, now known as volley ball was played in December of 1895. The game quickly grew very successful.Today, volleyball is estimated by the F&eacuted&eacuteration Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) as the most popular team sport in the world.</P>
