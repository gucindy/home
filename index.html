		<h3> The History of Basketball</h3>
		<p>In 1891, the game of basketball was invented by a Canadian physical education instructor<a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Naismith> James Naismith. </a> At that time, James Naismith was given a task to teach a new indoor sport at the international YMCA training school in Springfield, Massachusetts. The creative instructor came up with the idea to create an indoor game played during the cold winters of Massachusetts that relied on skills, the game is what we now call basketball. James Naismith came up with 13 simple rules and used a soccer ball and two peach baskets for the setup of the first game. 
           In the 20th century, the game grew very popular nationwide and the equipment was modified for the convenience of the game. 
		   In 1936 it became an official Olympic sport played during the Berlin Olympics. After the quick establishment, professional games followed.

		<h3> The History of Volleyball</h3> 
		<p> The game of volleyball was invented in 1985 by  <a href = "WilliamGMorgan.html"> William G. Morgan</a> a YMCA physical education director in Holyoke, Massachusetts. He designed a game of volleyball at that time called mintonette to be a combination of elements in basketball, baseball, tennis, and handball. William G Morgan wanted to create a game for his class of elders which would be less intense than basketball but still requires physical exercise.
		    William Morgan set up the first game by using the tennis net, and raised it 6 feet 6 inches above the floor. As the players played, they seemed to have been volleying the ball back and forth, therefore, the new name- volleyball was given. Volleyball rules were slightly modified by the International YMCA Training School and the game spread around the country to various YMCAs. The first YMCA national championship for basketball was held in 1922,then the Olympics and other national events followed. Today, volleyball has grew into a popular sport played nationwide with variation such as beach volleyball and indoor volleyball.</p>
